# Quanser-Q-Bot-Bin-Sorting-Using-Line-Finding-
This project leverages Quanser Simulation Lab in an environment that uses a ultrasonic and colour sensors mounted on a Q-Bot to accurately sort recyclables and waste into their appropriate bins

## How It Works

### Q-Bot Simulation (Q-Labs Python Files/Student_Files/P3_Simulation_Template.py)

The core functionality of this project revolves around loading containers from a bottle dispensary into the Q-Bot and having the Q-Bot travel around a line-track and dispense the containers into appropriate bins.
